#goal: simple program that allow me to roll for multiple monsters at once and adds relevant stats
    #plan:
        #Load monsters from text file. Be able to edit the file on fly as the program is running
        #Save any number of monster in code including relevatn stats. (monsters as objects?)
        #Input to determine relevant stat and roll difficulty.
        #Output Name of monster, roll + modifier, pass/fail, crit (nat 1 or 20)
        #Order monsters in order of iniciative
            #Keep the order even when adding/removing monsters from the text file
